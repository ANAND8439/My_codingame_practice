Here's how you can implement a Python script to display the symbols based on cardinal and ordinal directions, given an input direction:

python
Copy code
def display_direction_symbol(direction):
    symbols = {
        'NORTH': ['*', '|'],
        'SOUTH': ['|', '*'],
        'EAST': ['----*'],
        'WEST': ['*----'],
        'NORTHEAST': [' *\n/'],
        'SOUTHEAST': ['\\\n *'],
        'NORTHWEST': ['*\n \\'],
        'SOUTHWEST': ['/\n *']
    }
    
    if direction in symbols:
        for line in symbols[direction]:
            print(line)
    else:
        print("Direction not recognized.")

# Example usage:
direction = input().strip()
display_direction_symbol(direction)
